# Pokemon

The aim of this project is to experiment with python classes and functions to create a game system similar to the popular game series Pokémon. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Pokémon, it is a game where creatures (Pokémon) battle against each other. 
Every Pokémon has statistics associated with it like health, level, type, and a name. 
In this project several classes and functions are builded that interact with each other in order to simulate Pokémon battles.
